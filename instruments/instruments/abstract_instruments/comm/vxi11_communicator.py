    Wraps a VXI-11 device. Arguments are all essentially just passed
    to `vxi11.Instrument`.
    
    VXI-11 is an RPC-based communication protocol over ethernet primarily used 
    for connecting test and measurement equipment to controller hardware.
    VXI-11 allows for improved communication speeds and reduced latency over 
    that of communicating using TCP over a socket connection.
    
    VXI-11 is developed and maintained by the IVI Foundation. More information
    can be found on their website, as well as that of the LXI standard website.
    
    VXI-11 has since been superseeded by HiSLIP, which features fixes, improved
    performance, and new features such as IPv6 support.
