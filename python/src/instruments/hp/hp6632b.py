    """
    The HP6632b is a system dc power supply with an output rating of 0-20V/0-5A,
    precision low current measurement and low output noise.

    According to the manual this class MIGHT be usable for any HP power supply
    with a model number HP663Xb where X in {1, 2, 3, 4}, HP661Xc with X in {1,
    2, 3, 4} and HP663X2A with X in {1, 3}.

    HOWEVER, it has only been tested by the author with a HP6632b power supply.

    Example usage:
    >>> import instruments as ik
    >>> psu = ik.hp.HP6632b.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 6)
    >>> psu.voltage = 10 # Sets voltage to 10V.
