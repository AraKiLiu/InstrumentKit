class Event(object):
    """
    Represents an event that can be listened to by zero or more delegates
    (callbacks).
    
    Delegates are callables that accept three arguments, ``(sender, event,
    event_obj)``. Here, ``event`` is the instance of `Event` that the delegate
    was added to, and ``event_obj`` is an object prepared by the sender
    containing additional information about the event. If the sender did not
    provide any additional information, then ``event_obj`` is `None`.
    
    :param object sender: An object to mark as the *sender* of an event, useful
        for delegates that listen to the same event from multiple objects.
