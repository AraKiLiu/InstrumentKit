    The Agilent 34410a is a very popular 6.5 digit DMM. This class should also
    cover the Agilent 34401a, 34411a, as well as the backwards compatability
    mode in the newer Agilent/Keysight 34460a/34461a. You can find the full 
    specifications for these instruments on the `Keysight website`_.
    
    Example usage:
    
    >>> import instruments as ik
    >>> import quantities as pq
    >>> dmm = ik.agilent.Agilent34410a.open_gpib('/dev/ttyUSB0', 1)
    >>> print dmm.measure(dmm.Mode.resistance)
