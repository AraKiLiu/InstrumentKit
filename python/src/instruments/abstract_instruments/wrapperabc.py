        Read the current instrument address
        '''
        raise NotImplementedError

        Change the instrument address

        Read the EOS termination
        '''
        raise NotImplementedError
    def setterminator(self, newval):
        '''
        Change the communication EOS terminator
        '''

        Get the connection interface timeout
        '''
        raise NotImplementedError
    def settimeout(self, newval):

    ## METHODS ##
    
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def sendcmd(self, msg):
        '''
        Sends the incoming msg down to the wrapped file-like object
        but appends any other commands or termination characters required
        by the communication.
        
        This differs from the wrapper .write method which directly exposes
        the communication channel without appending other data.
        '''
        raise NotImplementedError
    
    @abc.abstractmethod    
    def query(self, msg, size=-1):
        '''
        Send a string to the connected instrument using sendcmd and read the
        response. This is an abstract method because there are situations where
        information contained in the sent command is needed for reading logic.
        
        An example of this is the Galvant Industries GPIB adapter where if
        you are connected to an older instrument and the query command does not
        contain a `?`, then the command `+read` needs to be send to force the
        instrument to send its response.
        '''
        raise NotImplementedError
        
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def flush_input(self):
        '''
        Instruct the wrapper to flush the input buffer, discarding the entirety
        of its contents.
        '''
        raise NotImplementedError
