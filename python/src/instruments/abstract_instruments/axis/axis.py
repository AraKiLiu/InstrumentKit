class Axis(object):
    """
    Axis representing a single physical axis-object such as a stepper motor,
    galvos, piezo stages, etc.
    
    At its most basic, an axis is something that has a position and that can be
    moved. By querying and setting the position, the origin for this axis
    can be defined, while the :meth:`~Axis.move` method instructs the device
    exposing this axis to move to a specified position.
    
    .. warning::
    
        This class shoult NOT be manually created by the user.
