class ParallelAC(AxisCollection):
    """
    Joins two sets of `AxisCollection` into a parallel axes system. In a 
    raster, the fine axis scans rapidly. Both sets of axes should be the same
    length. They are parallel in the sense that the first coarse axis is
    parallel to the first fine axis, the second to the second, and so on.
    As such, the units should be compatible from the first to  the first, etc.
    
    Note that this class could in principle be implemented so that 
    it exposes a single virtual axis collection, where the fact that there is
    a fine and coarse axis is completely hidden from the user -- that is
    to say, for example, if the coarse had XY and the fine had XY, then this
    class would expose a single XY system with only two coordinates. This 
    would be interesting and somewhat useful, but the huge problem would be
    losing credibility in bidirectional repeatability.
    As such this class exposes all coarse and fine axes separately, and is 
    only parallel in the sense that rastering is partially automated in a
    parallel sense.
    
    Note that `scan` cannot in general be implemented more cleverly then just 
    calling a whole bunch of `move` commands, whereas `raster` can be 
    implemented with calls to `raster` on the fine axis and `move` on the 
    coarse axis.    
    
    In all methods and properties, this combined axis system places the course 
    axes first, and the fine axes second.
    
    :param AxisCollection coarse_axes: The coarse axis collection. Should have
        the same number of axes as `fine_axes`.
    :param AxisCollection fine_axes: The fine axis collection. Should have
